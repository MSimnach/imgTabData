This project consists of code to obtain datasets and dataloaders for open source image-tabular data as well as preprocessing pipelines to make them suitable for the deep nonparametric conditional independence test (DNCIT) from the R package `vignette("DNCIT")`.


## Datasets

#### Skin Cancer (PAD-UFES-20) Dataset

The PAD-UFES-20 dataset is a comprehensive collection of skin lesion images and associated metadata, including clinical information about patients. The images are captured using smartphones, making the dataset particularly relevant for real-world applications and teledermatology. This dataset is a skin lesion benchmark composed of clinical images collected from smartphone devices and a set of patient clinical data containing up to 21 features. The dataset includes:

- **1373 patients**
- **1641 skin lesions**
- **2298 images**

#### COVID-19 Image Data Collection

This dataset currently contains hundreds of frontal view X-rays and is the largest public resource for COVID-19 image and prognostic data, making it a necessary resource to develop and evaluate tools to aid in the treatment of COVID-19. It was manually aggregated from publication figures as well as various web-based repositories into a machine learning (ML) friendly format with accompanying dataloader code. The dataset includes:

- Frontal and lateral view imagery
- Metadata such as the time since first symptoms, intensive care unit (ICU) status, survival status, intubation status, or hospital location
